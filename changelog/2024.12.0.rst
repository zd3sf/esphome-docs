ESP-IDF
-------

ESPHome has now updated the core ESP32 code to use `ESP-IDF <https://github.com/espressif/esp-idf/>`__ 5.1.5.
This is a major upgrade and should bring more features, chip support (Most notably the ESP32-C6 that people keep raving on about)
and in general more stability.

To acommodate this change, ESPHome has moved away from the "official" platformio provided ESP32 platform,
and is now using a community fork `pioarduino/platform-espressif32 <https://github.com/pioarduino/platform-espressif32>`__ as platformio
has decided to stop providing ESP-IDF updates to their platform for Espressif chips. As a user, you should not notice any difference.

As we are unable to test every single component and board, there might be issues with specific configurations. Please report these in
the `ESPHome issue tracker <https://github.com/esphome/issues/issues>`__ on GitHub.


ESPHome ``armv7`` Docker Support
--------------------------------

We will be retiring ESPHome's Docker support for ``armv7`` hardware in the February 2025 release.

This is due to both waning support as it relates to tooling and performance reasons. We strongly recommend moving to a
more modern architecture, especially if you're using the ESPHome Device Compiler to build/compile firmware for your
devices.
